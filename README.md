# [candle-light][]

A small bad lisp-like language

Play with it using stack

Once you've done that, start working on your project with the Stack commands
you know and love.

``` sh
# Build the project.
stack build

# Run the test suite.
stack test

# Run the benchmarks.
stack bench

# Generate documentation.
stack haddock
```

Thanks again, and happy hacking!
